# Reliable and Real-Time Anomaly Detection for Safety-Relevant Systems

## Abstract

This repository contains the source code and a JAR file for the Anomaly Detection approach presented in "Reliable and Real-Time Anomaly Detection for
Safety-Relevant Systems" by Heermann et al.. The code generates the data sets that were presented in the paper and implements the algorithm presented for anomaly detection utilising a system model.
Then the approach is exectued on the generated data sets and the results given out on the console.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Java 11 or higher

### Installation
1. Download the JAR file "Bouncer-Monitor-1.0-all.jar".
2. Ensure you have Java 11 or higher installed on your system.
3. [If applicable, instructions to set up any necessary environment variables or configurations.]

## Usage

Due to the fact that the Affine Arithmetic Decision Diagram (AADD) library is not directly publicly available, I packed all the dependencies into the "Bouncer-Monitor-1.0-all.jar".

### Running the JAR
To run the application, use the following command:
```sh
java -jar path/to/Bouncer-Monitor-1.0-all.jar
```
